# OpenFOAM_Laminar
This is a laminar boundary layer case using OpenFOAM icoFoam slover

The boundary conditions in the U file are ...
we have zeroGradient on the top and bottom of the entrance region.
we have constant velocity on the left side of entrance region.
we have zeroGradient on the top of the flat plate region and the right hand side.
we have noSlip condiiton on bottom of flat plate region.

for the future we want to include trubulence modelling...
